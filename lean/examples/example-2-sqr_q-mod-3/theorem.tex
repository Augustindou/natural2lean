Theorem Square mod 3:
If $q$ is a natural not divisible by $3$, then $q^2 \mod 3 = 1$.


Proof:
Considering the different possibilities of the modulo operation, we have $q \mod 3 \in \{ 0, 1, 2 \}$
For the first case, as $q$ is not divisible by $3$, we have a contradiction for $0$.
For the second case, we have $q \mod 3 = 1$
    By definition of the modulo operation, we have $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q = 3k + 1$
    By expansion, we have $q^2 = (3k+1)^2 = 9k^2+6k+1 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1$
    hence, we have $q^2 \mod 3 = 1$
For the last case, by definition of the modulo operation, we have $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q = 3k + 2$ 
    Following the same expansion, we have $q^2 = (3k+2)^2 = 3(3k^2+4k+1) +1$
    Hence, we have $q^2 \mod 3 = 1$ again
