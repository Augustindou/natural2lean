Theorem square of q divisible by 3 means q is divisible by 3: If $q \in \mathbb{N}$ and $q^2$ is divisible by $3$, then $q$ is also divisible by $3$.


Proof:
By contrapositive, we have that if $q$ is not divisible by $3$, then $q^2$ is not divisible by $3$.
By the "square mod 3" theorem, we have $q^2 \mod 3 = 1$
Hence $q^2$ is not divisible by $3$.
